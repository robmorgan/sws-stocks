Here's a collection of bugs I've identified, but haven't had time to address:

### UX

- [ ] The frontend reset button does not properly reset the filters inputs.

### Cosmetic

- [ ] The text on the light mode is unreadable.
- [ ] The dark mode has a solid bar across the top.
- [ ] The stock tooltip obscure the line chart.
